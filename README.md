Wrote this when I was first learening to code. The only reason I don't remove it is because it is cute lol

functions:
-

- sceneKit() - creates a cube, just input the SCNView you want the cube loaded in
- cubeNavigation() - input navigation destinations
- cubeHitTesting() - hit testing within the scene
